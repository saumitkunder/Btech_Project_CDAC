### Introduction
The rapid digital transformation has increased network vulnerability to cyber threats, necessitating an intelligent detection system. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze network traffic and detect anomalies, providing early threat alerts and helping organizations mitigate security risks.

---

### Problem Statement
To design a model capable of detecting network anomalies that may indicate cyber threats, with the ability to:
- Distinguish normal from suspicious network activities
- Provide early warnings of potential attacks in real time
- Integrate seamlessly with existing network security infrastructures

---

### Objectives
1. **Real-Time Detection**: Develop a model that can monitor network traffic and detect anomalies in real time.
2. **Scalability and Adaptability**: Ensure the system can scale with network traffic and adapt to new types of threats.
3. **Minimize False Positives**: Improve precision to reduce unnecessary alerts.
4. **Ease of Integration**: Build a solution compatible with existing security systems such as firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

---

### Dataset
- **NSL-KDD**: This dataset includes network traffic data labeled as normal or anomalous.
- **CICIDS 2017**: A more recent dataset capturing various attack scenarios.

---

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn (for classical ML models)
  - TensorFlow, PyTorch (for deep learning models like Autoencoders, CNNs, and RNNs)
  - LIME, SHAP (for model interpretability)
- **Tools**: 
  - Jupyter Notebook (for development and analysis)
  - Git (for version control)
  - Docker (for containerization)
  - Kafka (for real-time data streaming)

---

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Using publicly available datasets, preprocess and label network traffic data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract features (e.g., packet size, connection duration, protocol type) relevant to identifying anomalies.
3. **Model Development**:
   - **ML Models**: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - **Deep Learning Models**: Autoencoders, CNNs, RNNs
   - **Hybrid Models**: Combining anomaly-based and signature-based approaches for a robust detection system
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess models on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Alert Mechanism**: Generate alerts with anomaly details when a threat is detected.

---

### Model Training and Evaluation
Models are trained using the **NSL-KDD** dataset with 10-fold cross-validation to ensure generalizability. Metrics used include:
- **Accuracy**: Overall model correctness
- **Precision**: Ratio of true positive predictions to total positive predictions
- **Recall**: Ratio of true positives to all actual positives
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics

---

### Results
The project shows that Random Forest outperforms KNN and SVM for detecting certain attack types, while deep learning models improve detection of complex and rare attacks. Key performance metrics are as follows:
- **KNN**: 98% accuracy on DoS attacks
- **SVM**: Balanced performance across attack types
- **Random Forest**: Highest accuracy overall, particularly for DoS and Probe attacks

---

### Project Outcome
The project successfully implements an anomaly detection framework that identifies network irregularities with high accuracy and low false positives. This system can significantly improve network security by providing real-time alerts for potential cyber threats.

---

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the efficacy of machine learning for anomaly detection in network traffic, presenting a scalable and adaptable solution for cybersecurity. The approach addresses limitations of traditional methods, offering a more robust and intelligent solution.

---

### Future Work
Future improvements could include:
1. Extending the model to detect new anomaly types as they emerge.
2. Integrating the system with advanced threat intelligence platforms.
3. Exploring unsupervised learning for novel attack types and reducing dependency on labeled data.
